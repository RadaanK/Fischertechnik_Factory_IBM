This python code can be used to connect the IoT platform to a Cloudant Database for storing the events.

To execute the code you first need to create an IBM IoT platform and a Cloudant Database.
Then you need to create service credentials for both services in order to access them.
Some instructions how to establish the connection can be found here: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQP8H/iot/platform/reference/dsc/cloudant.html
However this instruction is not the best one :(

An overview over the used python sdk can be found here: https://ibm-watson-iot.github.io/iot-python/
However this one is not very helpfull because it is very badly commented
