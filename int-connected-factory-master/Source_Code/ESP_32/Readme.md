# Readme
Next to the Arduino Nanos, one ESP32 (https://www.conrad.de/de/p/entwickler-platine-sbc-nodemcu-esp32-1656367.html) is used in the setup.
On the one side it is connected to a temperature/humidity sensor and on the other side (over USB) to the Raspberry Pi.

This folder contains the needed source code, which can be uploaded using the Arduino IDE (https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/)

The following picture shows the wiring:
