# Readme
This folder contains the current skill for the Watson Assistant (Chatbot). 
When a Watson Assistant instance has been created a skill (containing intents, entities and the dialog) can be imported. 
So the chatbot is ready to use after importing the skill and adding an integration (e.g. Slack)

# How to import the Skill
First you have to create a new skill:
![chatbot_create_skill](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/234399/files/022d2680-e518-11e9-84c9-628cdfae3d12)

Then you have to choose the dialog skill:
![chatbot_dialog_skill](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/234399/files/225ce580-e518-11e9-898e-c1ee1670f1ab)

Finally you can import the skill as json:
![chatbot_import_skill](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/234399/files/27219980-e518-11e9-8266-800a2c6a61f1)
